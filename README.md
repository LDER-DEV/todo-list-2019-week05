### Goal: Build a Simple Todo List

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project is heavliy carried by the addTask() function in my javascript file. This function creates a list item and adds the item into an empty Ul element in the HTML. Upon creation of the <li> element a class called  'task' is added and when the list item is clicked upon the class of complete is added to that <li>. There are also functions that clears all tasks and one that clears completed tasks. Through these processes another function named taskTotal() counts the amounts of tasks passed through the list. I also had a bit of fun experimenting with audio! There is a small easter egg if you click the mushroom monster next to the counter. Try it out!


Lessons Learned:
It was very interesting to learn about the creation of elements purely in javascript. I spent a good chunk of time experimenting with watching the changes to the DOM as things were added and removed.
